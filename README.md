## Motivation:
Improve Boundary Recall and Undersegmentation error of generating superpixels - a technique commonly used for computer vision applications.
The popular Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is an iterative yet fast approach to find customizable number of superpixels.
The proposed code is an attempt to increase boundary recall and decrease undersegmentation error of SLIC.

### SLIC Algorithm:

### Proposed Algorithm:
1. Generate edge map of original image.
2. Initialize cluster centers.
3. Run BFS for each cluster with center as source node.
4. Two pixels are “connected” if none of them are an edge pixel.
5. Stop exploring neighbors of pixel that is not connected.
6. Generate connected graph.
7. Calculate distance for pixels in connected graph. 
8. Assign cluster to a pixel if that cluster is the nearest one.


The proposed algorithm gave a better boundary recall but slightly worse undersegmentation error. 
The superpixels generated by this algorithm fail to be as smooth as SLIC to adhere to the exact object boundary.
